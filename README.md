ðŸš¢ About the Titanic Dataset
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets in data science and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic ship, which sank in 1912. The goal is to analyze and predict which passengers survived the tragedy based on features like age, sex, class, and more.
ðŸ“‚ Key Columns in the Dataset:
PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger

Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (Target Variable)

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower)

Name, Sex, Age: Personal details

SibSp: Siblings/Spouses aboard

Parch: Parents/Children aboard

Ticket, Fare: Travel details

Cabin: Cabin number (many missing)

Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

ðŸ§ª What We Can Do with EDA in Python
Using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in Python, we can:

1. Understand the Data
Get a summary of data using df.info(), df.describe()

Check the shape and structure

2. Identify and Handle Missing Values
Use df.isnull().sum() to find missing data

Impute or drop missing values

3. Analyze Distributions (Univariate Analysis)
Use histograms and count plots to explore individual columns like Age, Pclass, Survived, Embarked

4. Compare Relationships (Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis)
Analyze how survival varies with:

Gender (Sex)

Age groups

Passenger class (Pclass)

Family members aboard (SibSp, Parch)

5. Detect Outliers
Use box plots to find outliers in Age, Fare, etc.

6. Visualize Trends
Use libraries like:

Matplotlib for basic plots

Seaborn for attractive visuals like heatmaps, bar plots, pairplots

7. Feature Engineering (Optional)
Create new features like:

IsAlone (based on SibSp + Parch)

Title extracted from Name

Age groups like Child, Adult, Senior

ðŸ”§ Python Libraries Used:
pandas â€“ data handling

numpy â€“ numerical operations

matplotlib.pyplot â€“ basic plotting

seaborn â€“ advanced, attractive plots
